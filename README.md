Students from IITs, NITs, and AIIMS often struggle to 
find reliable, organized study materials before exams. 
Scattered notes, last-minute panic, and no proper 
platform to buy/sell resources create unnecessary 
chaos.
It is a collaborative web platform where students can:
● Access curated class notes, previous year papers, and 
study guides
● Buy/Sell their own handwritten or digital notes
● Connect with peers to exchanges resources
● Search materials by college, subject, or exam
